NumPy: Data statistics

The data in populations.txt describes the populations of hares and lynxes (and carrots) in northern Canada during 20 years.

Computes and print, based on the data in populations.txt (use loadtxt to read the file)...

    1. The mean and std of the populations of each species for the years in the period.
    2. Which year each species had the largest population.
    3. Which species has the largest population for each year. (Hint: argsort & fancy indexing of np.array(['H', 'L', 'C']))
    4. Which years any of the populations is above 50000. (Hint: comparisons and np.any)
    5. The top 2 years for each species when they had the lowest populations. (Hint: argsort, fancy indexing)
    6. Compare (plot) the change in hare population (see help(np.gradient)) and the number of lynxes. Check correlation (see help(np.corrcoef)).

... all without for-loops.
