Create a Jupyter Notebook with each exercise in its own section.

EJercicio 1. Form the 2-D array (without typing it in explicitly):

[[1,  6, 11],
 [2,  7, 12],
 [3,  8, 13],
 [4,  9, 14],
 [5, 10, 15]]

and generate a new array containing its 2nd and 4th rows.

Ejercicio 2. Generate a 10 x 3 array of random numbers (in range [0,1]). For each row, pick the number closest to 0.5.
     
   Hints: Use abs and argsort to find the column j closest for each row.
          Use fancy indexing to extract the numbers.
